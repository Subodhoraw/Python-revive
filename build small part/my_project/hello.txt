Excellent — this question touches on **Python’s “context manager”** concept, which is key to writing safe and clean file-handling code. Let’s break it down clearly 👇

---

## 🧠 What Does the `with` Statement Do?

The `with` statement is used to **automatically manage resources** —
especially files — so you **don’t have to manually close them**.

When you use `with open(...) as f:`, Python will:

1. **Open the file**
2. Let you work with it
3. **Automatically close it**, even if an error occurs

✅ No need for `f.close()` — Python does it safely for you.

---

### 🔴 Without `with` (Risky Example)

```python
f = open("data.txt", "r")
lines = f.readlines()
f.close()
```

⚠️ Problem:
If something goes wrong before `f.close()`,
the file might **remain open** → resource leak!

---

### 🟢 With `with` (Safe Example)

```python
with open("data.txt", "r") as f:
    lines = f.readlines()
```

Now the file is **automatically closed**,
even if an exception (like `FileNotFoundError`) occurs.

---

## ⚙️ Function Example: `read_lines(path)`

Let’s write your requested safe function 👇

```python
def read_lines(path):
    """
    Safely reads all lines from a file and returns them as a list.
    """
    try:
        with open(path, "r") as file:
            lines = file.readlines()
            return lines
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print(f"Error: The file '{path}' was not found.")
        return []
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}")
        return []
```

---

### ✅ Example Usage

```python
lines = read_lines("notes.txt")
print(lines)
```

If `notes.txt` exists → it prints a list of lines
If not → it prints a friendly error message, no crash.

## 💡 Why Prefer `with`?

| Reason                       | Description                                                |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| ✅ Automatic cleanup          | Closes file automatically                                  |
| 🧱 Exception-safe            | Even if an error occurs, file closes                       |
| 🧠 Cleaner code              | No need for manual `close()`                               |
| 🧩 Works with many resources | Also works for network connections, database cursors, etc. |

## 🧠 Real-life Analogy

Think of `with` like a **hotel key card**:

* You use it (open the room)
* When you check out, it **automatically deactivates** (file closes)
* No risk of leaving the door open 🔒

Would you like me to extend this example to also include **writing** (`write_lines(path, data)`) using the same safe pattern?
